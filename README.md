## Emberpress pusher

Here in lies a fork of eviltrout's emberpress, whose original manuscripts
can be found [here](https://github.com/eviltrout/emberpress). The main goal
of this fork is to provide a non-trivial pusher integration. This integration
was demoed April 4th, 2013 at [Ember Toronto Meetup](http://torontoemberjs.com/).
